![Specfold v1.3.0 showing independent collection and folder collapse controls, a focused folder base URL editor, the effective routing source, and a request editor](docs/assets/specfold-main.png)

Specfold helps developers turn API specifications into a practical request workspace:

```text
OpenAPI / Swagger / Postman / Insomnia / HAR / .http / cURL
        -> editable collections, folders, and requests
        -> local environments and scoped collection/folder base URLs
        -> request testing, response inspection, and variable capture
        -> OpenAPI YAML / JSON export
```

It is intentionally local-first. There is no account requirement, no cloud workspace, and no hosted sync layer. Your workspace, environments, request history, and secrets stay on the machine running the desktop app.

Verify a downloaded package against the published checksums:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt --ignore-missing
```

On Windows PowerShell, compare `Get-FileHash .\Specfold-1.3.0-x64.exe -Algorithm SHA256` with the matching line in `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

Unsigned Windows builds may trigger SmartScreen. Unsigned and non-notarized macOS builds may require opening from Finder with **Open** to confirm the Gatekeeper prompt.

See the [Code signing policy](docs/CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md) for signing scope,
approval roles, build provenance, privacy, and the current SignPath Foundation
application status. Release artifacts remain unsigned until that policy
explicitly states that signing is active.

### v1.3.0 Highlights

- `multipart/form-data` request bodies now support text rows, file rows, repeated field names, native file selection, and automatic boundary generation.
- OpenAPI, Swagger, Postman, Insomnia, HAR, and cURL imports create safe file placeholders without trusting local source paths.
- Upload files are session-only and are never written into workspaces, backups, Collection JSON, OpenAPI exports, or copied cURL commands.
- OpenAPI import now prefers multipart file content over JSON alternatives when an operation offers both.

## What It Does

- Imports OpenAPI 3.x, Swagger 2.0, Postman Collection v2.0/v2.1 JSON and v3 YAML folders, Insomnia JSON v4/v5, HAR 1.2, `.http`/`.rest`, Specfold Collection JSON, and `curl` commands.
- Preserves portable collection folders, environment variables, supported auth modes, request bodies, and response examples where the source format provides them.
- Lets you select exactly which operations to import before creating requests.
- Groups imported endpoints by tag, first path segment, or a single folder.
- Organizes APIs into collections, folders, and requests with search, rename, duplicate, delete, and drag-and-drop movement.
- Collapses collections and nested folders independently while keeping search matches visible without losing the previous expanded state.
- Shows only the selected routing scope for base URL editing, alongside the effective URL and its environment, collection, or folder source.
- Edits request method, URL, query params, path params, headers, body, and auth.
- Builds `multipart/form-data` bodies with text and file rows, repeated field names, native file selection, and an automatically generated boundary.
- Supports bearer token, basic auth, API key auth, and no-auth request modes.
- Sends HTTP requests from the desktop app and shows status, timing, size, headers, body, raw response, and per-request history.
- Copies any request as a `curl` command.
- Copies generated export content directly from the preview to the clipboard.
- Saves JSON response fields directly into environment variables.
- Exports a whole collection or selected folders back to OpenAPI YAML/JSON.
- Exports a complete local backup containing collections, environments, settings, and secrets after an explicit security warning.
- Permanently deletes all local content, settings, and rotating backups through a two-step confirmation.
- Runs an export structure check before saving generated OpenAPI.

## Supported Import Formats

| Format | Accepted input | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 | JSON, YAML | Local references, multipart schemas, and source-operation fidelity |
| Swagger 2.0 | JSON, YAML | Request model conversion, including multipart `formData` |
| Postman 2.0/2.1 | Collection JSON | Folders, variables, auth, bodies, multipart placeholders, examples |
| Postman 3 | Multi-file YAML folder | Scripts and symlinks are skipped |
| Insomnia 4/5 | Export JSON | Workspaces, folders, environments, multipart placeholders, responses |
| HAR 1.2 | JSON | Captured requests, multipart placeholders, and response examples |
| HTTP files | `.http`, `.rest` | Declarative requests only; scripts are not executed |
| Specfold | Collection JSON | Native portable collection |
| cURL | Command text | Common method/header/body/auth flags and `-F`/`--form` fields |

Malformed or unsupported records are reported without executing imported scripts. Folder imports are bounded by depth, file count, and total bytes.

## Base URLs And Environments

Specfold separates environment defaults from collection- and folder-level routing:

- Every workspace starts with an active `Specfold` environment; environments can be renamed, and the final environment cannot be deleted.
- Environment `baseUrl` is a convenient default for new collections and bulk updates.
- New collections copy the active environment `baseUrl` as their starting collection base URL.
- Collection `baseUrl` overrides the environment `baseUrl` when requests resolve `{{baseUrl}}`.
- A folder `baseUrl` overrides both values for every request below that folder; nested folders inherit the nearest configured parent and can override it again.
- Absolute request URLs always stay unchanged. Relative request URLs are joined to the effective base URL, so both `/orders` and `{{baseUrl}}/orders` are supported.
- Collection `baseUrl` can be edited directly from the request workspace, even when no request is selected.
- Select a folder in the collection tree to edit its base URL. Leaving it empty restores inheritance.
- The request workspace keeps only the selected scope's base URL field visible and shows the resolved effective URL and source beside it.
- Updating an environment `baseUrl` can optionally apply the same value to all collection base URLs.
- Imported OpenAPI/Swagger `servers` are mapped into collection base URL data.

Effective precedence is: absolute request URL, nearest folder `baseUrl`, collection `baseUrl`, then environment `baseUrl`. This keeps two proxy folders isolated inside one collection.

## Apinizer JWT Workflow

Specfold includes an Apinizer-focused JWT request template:

1. Import an OpenAPI/Swagger document exported from Apinizer.
2. Create an **Apinizer JWT request** from the New menu.
3. Specfold creates an **Apinizer Auth** folder and derives its base URL from the API origin when possible. For example, `https://api.tarimorman.gov.tr/dats/cks` becomes `https://api.tarimorman.gov.tr`, producing `https://api.tarimorman.gov.tr/auth/jwt`.
4. Review or override the folder base URL, then set environment values such as `username`, `password`, and `clientId`.
5. Send the token request.
6. Use **Save field to variable** on the response to store `access_token` as `{{accessToken}}`.
7. Use bearer auth with `{{accessToken}}` on other requests.
8. Export the selected folder or collection as OpenAPI YAML/JSON.

## Form Data And File Uploads

Choose **Body -> Form data** for endpoints that accept `multipart/form-data`:

1. Add a text field or file field.
2. Enter the field name expected by the API. Duplicate names are allowed for multi-file endpoints.
3. For a file field, choose the file through the native picker. The optional media type defaults from the file extension.
4. Send the request. Specfold generates the multipart boundary and `Content-Type` header automatically.

Imported OpenAPI, Swagger, Postman, Insomnia, HAR, and cURL file fields are safe placeholders: their local source paths are not trusted or read. Choose each file again before sending. Files are referenced for the current app session only and are not embedded in exports or backups.

## Data And Security

- Workspaces are saved locally using atomic writes.
- Rotating workspace backups are kept.
- Corrupt workspace files are quarantined instead of overwritten.
- Environment variables marked secret are encrypted at rest with Electron `safeStorage`.
- Complete backup exports intentionally contain readable secret values, require explicit confirmation, and use `0600` permissions where supported.
- Restore accepts only `specfold.backup.v1`, caps reads at 100 MB, validates workspace/settings, creates a safety copy, re-encrypts secrets, and rolls back both files on failure.
- If encryption is unavailable, secret values are never persisted as plaintext and the application shows a persistent warning.
- Export warnings flag literal values that look like secrets.
- Parameter and header values are not emitted as OpenAPI examples unless explicitly enabled.
- Unused component schemas are pruned from folder-scoped exports by default.
- HTTP requests use configurable timeouts and capped response bodies.
- Upload files are granted only after an explicit native file-picker selection. Specfold keeps an opaque, session-only reference in memory; local paths and file bytes are never written to the workspace, backup, Collection JSON, or OpenAPI export.
- Multipart requests allow at most 200 parts, including at most 50 files, and 100 MB of file and text content per send. Files must be selected again after restarting the app, restoring a backup, or importing a collection.
- Insecure TLS is opt-in.
- System proxy rules are used, with `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` fallback.
- The desktop renderer runs with `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`, and a packaged Content Security Policy.

See [docs/REDTEAM_REPORT.md](docs/REDTEAM_REPORT.md) for the v1.1 security review, threat model, closed findings, and remaining release risks.

### Backup, Restore, And Delete

Open **Settings -> Data management**:

1. **Export backup** asks whether to include readable secrets, then writes the complete workspace and settings.
2. **Restore backup** confirms replacement, validates the selected file, and reports the pre-restore safety-copy path on success.
3. **Delete all data** requires both a warning confirmation and exact `DELETE ALL` text. It removes workspace, settings, rotating/safety backups, and quarantined workspace files, then creates a fresh `Specfold` environment.

Backup files are sensitive because they intentionally include secrets. Store them in an encrypted location and delete copies you no longer need.

## Installation Notes

### Windows

Download the installer or portable `.exe`. If SmartScreen appears, verify the file came from the GitHub release and choose **More info** -> **Run anyway**.

### macOS

Download the `.dmg` or `.zip` for your architecture:

- Apple Silicon: `arm64`
- Intel: `x64`

Because v1.3.0 is not notarized, macOS may require opening the app from Finder with **Open**.

### Linux

Download the `.AppImage` or `.deb`.

```bash
chmod +x Specfold-1.3.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage
./Specfold-1.3.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

For Debian-based distributions:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i Specfold-1.3.0-linux-amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

## Development

Requires Node.js 20+ and npm 10+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Build Locally

```bash
npm run package:win:portable     # Windows portable .exe
npm run package:win:installer    # Windows NSIS installer
npm run package:win              # Windows portable + installer
npm run package:mac              # macOS dmg + zip, x64 + arm64; run on macOS
npm run package:linux            # Linux AppImage + deb, x64; run on Linux
```

Artifacts are written to `apps/desktop/dist`.

## Release

Run the release workflow manually first. `workflow_dispatch` builds and verifies every package plus `SHA256SUMS.txt` without creating a tag or release. Tag pushes run the same package gate and create a draft GitHub Release.

```bash
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Specfold v1.3.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.3.0
```

Public release assets are only the two Windows packages, four macOS packages, Linux AppImage/DEB, and `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Builder debug YAML, updater YAML, and blockmaps are excluded. The generated release stays draft until manual smoke tests pass.

## Known Limitations

- Release builds are not code-signed yet.
- macOS builds are not notarized yet.
- Complete backups are plaintext by design and may contain secrets.
- Very large imports/exports can still use the renderer thread, within configured size limits.
- Auto-update is not implemented in v1.3.0.
- SOCKS proxies are not supported; configure an HTTP(S) proxy for Specfold.
- Multipart uploads are capped at 200 parts, 50 files, and 100 MB of file and text content per request; selected files must be chosen again after an app restart.
