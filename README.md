![Specfold desktop app showing the collection tree, collection base URL, request editor, and response panel](docs/assets/specfold-main.png)

Specfold helps developers turn API specifications into a practical request workspace:

```text
OpenAPI / Swagger / Postman / Insomnia / HAR / .http / cURL
        -> editable collections, folders, and requests
        -> local environments and collection-level base URLs
        -> request testing, response inspection, and variable capture
        -> OpenAPI YAML / JSON export
```

It is intentionally local-first. There is no account requirement, no cloud workspace, and no hosted sync layer. Your workspace, environments, request history, and secrets stay on the machine running the desktop app.

Unsigned Windows builds may trigger SmartScreen. Unsigned and non-notarized macOS builds may require opening from Finder with **Open** to confirm the Gatekeeper prompt.

## What It Does

- Imports OpenAPI 3.x, Swagger 2.0, Postman Collection v2.0/v2.1 JSON and v3 YAML folders, Insomnia JSON v4/v5, HAR 1.2, `.http`/`.rest`, Specfold Collection JSON, and `curl` commands.
- Preserves portable collection folders, environment variables, supported auth modes, request bodies, and response examples where the source format provides them.
- Lets you select exactly which operations to import before creating requests.
- Groups imported endpoints by tag, first path segment, or a single folder.
- Organizes APIs into collections, folders, and requests with search, rename, duplicate, delete, and drag-and-drop movement.
- Edits request method, URL, query params, path params, headers, body, and auth.
- Supports bearer token, basic auth, API key auth, and no-auth request modes.
- Sends HTTP requests from the desktop app and shows status, timing, size, headers, body, raw response, and per-request history.
- Copies any request as a `curl` command.
- Saves JSON response fields directly into environment variables.
- Exports a whole collection or selected folders back to OpenAPI YAML/JSON.
- Exports a complete local backup containing collections, environments, settings, and secrets after an explicit security warning.
- Permanently deletes all local content, settings, and rotating backups through a two-step confirmation.
- Runs an export structure check before saving generated OpenAPI.

## Base URLs And Environments

Specfold separates environment defaults from collection-level routing:

- Every workspace starts with an active `Specfold` environment; environments can be renamed, and the final environment cannot be deleted.
- Environment `baseUrl` is a convenient default for new collections and bulk updates.
- New collections copy the active environment `baseUrl` as their starting collection base URL.
- Collection `baseUrl` overrides the environment `baseUrl` when requests resolve `{{baseUrl}}`.
- Collection `baseUrl` can be edited directly from the request workspace, even when no request is selected.
- Updating an environment `baseUrl` can optionally apply the same value to all collection base URLs.
- Imported OpenAPI/Swagger `servers` are mapped into collection base URL data.

This lets teams keep environment-level defaults while still allowing each collection to point at a different gateway, tenant, or service boundary.

## Apinizer JWT Workflow

Specfold includes an Apinizer-focused JWT request template:

1. Import an OpenAPI/Swagger document exported from Apinizer.
2. Create an **Apinizer JWT request** from the New menu.
3. Set collection or environment values such as `baseUrl`, `username`, `password`, and `clientId`.
4. Send the token request.
5. Use **Save field to variable** on the response to store `access_token` as `{{accessToken}}`.
6. Use bearer auth with `{{accessToken}}` on other requests.
7. Export the selected folder or collection as OpenAPI YAML/JSON.

## Data And Security

- Workspaces are saved locally using atomic writes.
- Rotating workspace backups are kept.
- Corrupt workspace files are quarantined instead of overwritten.
- Environment variables marked secret are encrypted at rest with Electron `safeStorage`.
- Complete backup exports intentionally contain readable secret values and require explicit confirmation.
- If encryption is unavailable, secret values load back empty instead of being persisted as plaintext.
- Export warnings flag literal values that look like secrets.
- Parameter and header values are not emitted as OpenAPI examples unless explicitly enabled.
- Unused component schemas are pruned from folder-scoped exports by default.
- HTTP requests use configurable timeouts and capped response bodies.
- Insecure TLS is opt-in.
- System proxy rules are used, with `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` fallback.
- The desktop renderer runs with `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`, and a packaged Content Security Policy.

## Installation Notes

### Windows

Download the installer or portable `.exe`. If SmartScreen appears, verify the file came from the GitHub release and choose **More info** -> **Run anyway**.

### macOS

Download the `.dmg` or `.zip` for your architecture:

- Apple Silicon: `arm64`
- Intel: `x64`

Because v1.0.3 is not notarized, macOS may require opening the app from Finder with **Open**.

### Linux

Download the `.AppImage` or `.deb`.

```bash
chmod +x Specfold-1.0.3-linux-x86_64.AppImage
./Specfold-1.0.3-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

For Debian-based distributions:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i Specfold-1.0.3-linux-amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

## Project Layout

```text
apps/desktop      Electron app: main process, preload bridge, React renderer
packages/core     Model, importers, exporters, variable resolution, HTTP preparation
docs/             Product notes, architecture, import/export rules, security review
```

## Development

Requires Node.js 20+ and npm 10+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Build Locally

```bash
npm run package:win:portable     # Windows portable .exe
npm run package:win:installer    # Windows NSIS installer
npm run package:win              # Windows portable + installer
npm run package:mac              # macOS dmg + zip, x64 + arm64; run on macOS
npm run package:linux            # Linux AppImage + deb, x64; run on Linux
```

Artifacts are written to `apps/desktop/dist`.

## Release

The release workflow runs on `v*` tags and builds Windows, macOS, and Linux packages.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.3 -m "v1.0.3"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.3
```

The workflow creates a draft GitHub Release with generated release notes and all platform artifacts attached.

## Known Limitations

- Release builds are not code-signed yet.
- macOS builds are not notarized yet.
- Auto-update is not implemented in v1.0.3.
- SOCKS proxies are not supported; configure an HTTP(S) proxy for Specfold.
