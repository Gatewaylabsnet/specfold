# Product Spec

## Goal

Specfold is a simple, local-first desktop REST API collection studio for developers who want to turn common API interchange formats into an editable, account-free request workspace.

## Core Jobs

- Import OpenAPI, Swagger, Postman, Insomnia, HAR, HTTP files, Specfold JSON, and cURL.
- Preview and select operations before import without executing embedded scripts.
- Create and organize collections, nested folders, requests, and JWT templates.
- Manage renameable environments and resolve `{{variableName}}` values with collection base URL precedence.
- Send requests outside browser CORS restrictions and inspect/capture responses.
- Export selected content to OpenAPI or native Collection JSON with secret warnings.
- Export, validate, and restore a complete local backup; delete every local Specfold data file with strong confirmation.

## Product Principles

- Simple defaults: the first launch creates one active `Specfold` environment.
- Local by default: no account, cloud workspace, telemetry, or hosted sync.
- Portable but explicit: broad import support, visible fidelity warnings, no script execution.
- Safe persistence: atomic writes, encryption at rest, restore rollback, and no plaintext fallback for secrets.

## Non-Goals For v1.1

- Auto-update.
- Windows code signing or Apple signing/notarization.
- Cloud sync, collaboration, accounts, or remote `$ref` fetching.
- Postman/Insomnia script execution or automatic file upload restoration.
- SOCKS proxy support.

## Success Gate

Typecheck, unit/renderer tests, production build, tagless multi-platform package verification, checksums, layout review, and packaged smoke tests must pass before the draft v1.1.0 release is published.
