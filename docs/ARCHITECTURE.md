# Architecture

## Layers

1. Electron bootstrap configures the single-instance lifecycle, window, CSP, and IPC registration.
2. Electron services own storage, HTTP, import-source traversal, native dialogs, and proxy handling.
3. The preload exposes one typed `StudioApi`; its contracts live in `apps/desktop/src/shared/contracts.ts` and are shared by main, preload, and renderer.
4. React controller hooks own workspace, import, request, export, data-management, and safe re-import workflows.
5. React screens and tree components render editor, import, environments, export, and settings views.
6. Core pure functions own the model, importers, exporters, variables, cURL conversion, and HTTP preparation.

Production TypeScript, TSX, and CSS source files are kept below 500 lines. Generated output under `out` and `dist` is excluded.

## Data Flow

The renderer calls pure core import/export functions directly. Persistence, native file access, and outgoing HTTP cross the sandboxed preload bridge. IPC payloads use the shared contracts. Workspace mutations are serialized in main, while renderer autosave is debounced.

Multipart file bytes remain in the main-process boundary. A native picker registers a canonical local file under a random, session-only upload ID; the renderer receives only that ID plus display metadata. `Send` resolves approved IDs, revalidates the file, applies upload limits, and creates `FormData`. Imported or persisted IDs are not trusted, and multipart `Content-Type` is left to the fetch implementation so its boundary always matches the encoded body.

## Storage And Restore

- `workspace.json` and `app-settings.json` live under Electron `userData`.
- Workspace schema remains `schemaVersion: 1`; `ensureWorkspaceEnvironment` gives older workspaces an active environment.
- Writes use same-directory temporary files and atomic rename.
- Secret variables and literal sensitive request/auth/form/response-example values are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage`. If encryption is unavailable, plaintext sensitive values are never written and the renderer shows a persistent warning.
- Complete backups use `specfold.backup.v1`, intentionally contain readable secrets after explicit confirmation, and are written with `0600` permissions where supported.
- Restore input is capped at 100 MB and validates the root schema, workspace arrays/version, and settings.
- Restore creates a safety copy, writes workspace then settings serially, and rolls both files back if either write fails.
- Multipart upload IDs are transient and stripped from workspace, collection, and backup serialization. File contents and local paths are never persisted.

## Desktop Security Boundary

The renderer uses `sandbox: true`, `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, and packaged CSP. It cannot access Node or the filesystem directly. Import scripts are treated as data and are never executed.

## Import, Request, And Theme Boundaries

`Preview` parses an import through the same pure importer used by Import and exposes its non-fatal warnings as Import Doctor findings; it does not mutate the workspace. A safe re-import is opt-in, compares stable operation identities, preserves user-owned IDs/auth/bodies/examples, adds new operations into matching folder paths, and never removes an existing request.

The request editor uses the same core HTTP preparation function as the main process to display the resolved URL and missing variables before Send. The response panel remains renderer-only until the user explicitly saves a JSON value or response example through a workspace controller.

Theme preference is an `AppSettings` contract shared by main and renderer. The renderer resolves `system` to an active palette and applies semantic CSS tokens; the main process mirrors the choice through Electron `nativeTheme` and a matching window background.
